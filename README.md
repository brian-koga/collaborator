Collaborator is a web application that allows users to connect and work on projects together.

Often, someone has a good idea, but lacks key knowledge to start the project or to move past a specific hurdle. Collaborator's role is to give these people a way to advertise what they are looking for in a partner or even just a contributor.

Collaborator differs from other services such as open source projects because it gives owners of projects the freedom to select who can contribute to their project while also reaching a (hopefully) large number of people.

See the SRS for specific requirements of the software

Collaborator is currently in the design phase
